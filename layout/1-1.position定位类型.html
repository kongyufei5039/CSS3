            There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500 varieties
            of banana alone.

            By the time we add the countless types of apples, oranges, and other

            When travelling in Asia, I was struck by how many different
            kinds of bananas were avarible - many of which had unique
            flavours and which were only avaiable within a small region.
