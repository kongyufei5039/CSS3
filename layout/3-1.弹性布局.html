            There are of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500 varieties;
            of banana alone. By the time we add the countless type of apples, oranges,
            and other well-known fruit, we are faced with thousands of choices.

            One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the variety available in 
            each country. I live near London, in an area which is known for its apples.

            When travelling in Asia, I was struck by how many different kinds of banana
            were avariable - many of which had unique flavours and which were only 
            avariable within a small region.
